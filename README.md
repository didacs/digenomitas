# Digenomitas

This repository contains software for analyzing [digneome-sequencing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25664545) data.

## License

See the License file in this project. 

## Pre-requisites

1. A Java Development Kit v8 or higher available from [the Oracle Java site ](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
2. A working installation of the Scala Built Tool aka _sbt_ v1.1 or higher. Instructions for installing sbt can be found on the [SBT website](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).
3. A working internet connection which SBT will use to automatically download dependencies

## Building

The software has been built and tested on Linux and Mac OS X.  The software should build and run on any operating system that supports Java >= 8 and SBT, but other platforms have not been tested.

To compile and test the software run the following in the same directory as this README file:

```
sbt clean test
```

This process may take several minutes the first time it is run as sbt will download needed software libraries from the internet.  Repeated executions should take 15-30s.  A successful run of the tests will result in lines similar to the following being printed before sbt exits:

```
[info] All tests passed.
[info] Passed: Total 34, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 34
[success] Total time: 12 s, completed Oct 2, 2018 11:53:18 AM
```

The digenomitas software is compiled into a standalone [JAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) file for use.  To build the JAR file run:

```
sbt assembly
```

As with the tests, the last line printed should contain `[success]`, e.g.: 

```
[success] Total time: 17 s, completed Oct 2, 2018 11:54:27 AM
```

This will produce a JAR file located at `./digenome/target/scala-2.12/digenome.jar`.

## Running

The primary tool is run by invoking the following command with appropriate options:

```
java -Xmx8g -jar digenome/target/scala-2.12/digenome.jar IdentifyCutSites
```

### Input sequencing data

The tool expects as it's primary input a BAM file containing sorted, duplicate marked, aligned sequencing reads from a digenome experiment.  In our experience the following set of command yields results that work well with the software (though any reasonable WGS alignment pipeline should be compatible):

```
# Align the data and convert the output to BAM
bwa mem -p -R '<read-group-string>' -t 32 hg38.fa r1.fastq.gz r2.fastq.gz \
  | sambamba view --sam-input -l 1 -t 3 -f bam -o aligned.bam /dev/stdin

# Sort the data into coordinate order
sambamba sort -m 4G --tmpdir . -l 5 -t 16 -o sorted.bam aligned.bam

# Duplicate mark the data
picard -Duse_async_io_write_samtools=true -Xmx8g MarkDuplicates \
  I=sorted.bam O=deduped.bam M=dupe_metrics.txt CREATE_INDEX=true
```

The tools used in the above commands can be installed easily using [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and the included [conda-requirements.txt](conda-requirements.txt) as follows:

```
conda create -n digneome -c bioconda --file conda-requirements.txt
conda activate digenome
```

An example dataset is included in this repository.  The dataset is contains sequencing reads over nine 10kb wide regions from a sample treated with EMX1 guide `GTTCTGTCCTCAGTAAAAGGTA` and Staph aureus CAS9.  The regions include the expected on-target cut site and a number of putative off-target cut sites (including some likely false positives).
